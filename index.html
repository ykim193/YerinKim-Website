        <p class="lead mb-4">Yerin Kim is the daughter of James Kim and Kay Lim. Also, she has four years of older sister Joyce Kim and five years younger brother Royce Kim. Yerin Kim was born on September 18th, 2019 in Seoul where is the capital of South Korea. So since September 18th, 2019, she finally becomes 20 years old in American age. Someone calls her Yerin Kim but usually people who near next to her, people call her by Irene Kim. Yerin Kim graduated from kindergarten, elementary school, and middle school in South Korea which means she borns and raised in Seoul, South Korea until she becomes the age fifteen. After she graduated from middle school, Yerin Kim and her whole family member moved to South Carolina where is the United States of America. There were many white people in the village where she lived. It was not often for villagers to see an Asian. When they asked her name she answer with her real name which is Yerin Kim. However, it was so awarded pronunciation for them, So her name sounds weird and she did not like it. Also, Yerin and her family planned to live in America forever so she just decided to make a new English nickname and Irene Kim becomes her nickname which is American name.  Both of her real and nicknames have the same meaning which is peace in everything. Her dad James Kim made her real name because he hoped that Yerin will be safe wherever and whatever she is doing. So when she makes a nickname in America, she looked for a name that has the meaning of peace, and my nickname, Irene, is the name of the goddess of peace. Also, the pronounce for both her real name Yerin and nickname Irene is sounded similar so it was easy to make a familiar to myself. Irene Kim currently lives with her whole family member in Anaheim Hills, California. However, starting in the winter quarter, she will live by herself in Riverside which is off-campus because she wants to live near campus for more focus on her studies. Currently, Irene has a part-time job in Anaheim Hills where a near house like ten minutes away from her house where she lives with her family. During summer break in 2019, she did not take a summer school so she had nothing to do. So she just found a part-time job at the Stein Mart where retail chain for clothing, accessories, plus a variety of housewares and home decor. It was the first job in her entire life and it is a retail job so it was not that easy. However, she met good co-workers and manager so She still works there, and she has been there for about five months. However, it is placed in Anaheim Hills which means it is almost an hour from her school at the University of California Riverside. Irene Kimâ€™s is college students so her main job studies. However, if she keeps work in Stein Mart, it can affect her school grade. Consequently, she wants to live near the school to make more time to study and get a job near the school or on the campus.

        Yerin Kim or Irene Kim is currently enrolled as the second year of at the University of California Riverside and she majoring in sociology and administrative studies. However, since she got in and took a class at the University of California Riverside, she felt distracted in every major class because it was not interesting in that. Consequently, Irene Kim wants to change her major to accounting because since high school, she liked math and she is pretty good with that. However, she could not change yet because, last year, she enjoys her college life too much so her grade was pretty bad. However, starting the fall quarter of the 2019-2020 year at UCR, she takes relate class to accounting and she trying her best to improve her GPA for change major. The memory that Irene has that makes her extremely happy is when she got accepted to the University of California in Riverside. Irene moved to the United States of America five years ago, and when she got here first, her English proficiency was bad. So, she invested more time and effort than others to develop herself. Due to her language barrier in English, she fears to persuade her dreams in America. she was a sophomore in high school, she could not understand even half of the lecture. Irene used translators, dictionaries and internet websites even for small tasks. She was not able to communicate with her peers because she did not know-how. Nevertheless, she thought she could not get into college because she felt she was inadequate. So, when she received the notice of acceptance, Irene almost cried because it seemed to prove that the time and effort she had invested had not been in vain. Also, since after she moved to America, she was alone. Even she moved and live together with her whole family member, she got homesick. Irene missed her friends, food, places and more.  Korean culture and American culture are totally different so it took her 2 years just to understand the basics of American culture and school dynamics. Irene was borns and grew up in South Korea so she used to with Korean culture. However, the people who next to her were all American so it was very hard to make them understand and follow her. So Irene just followed her friendâ€™s culture which is American or Mexican culture. Even Irene Kim met a lot of good friends and teachers and had a wonderful highschool life, she always felt alone because of the cultural problem. Sometimes, people cannot understand Irene and her culture. However, in her school where the University of California Riverside, she made a lot of Korean friends who can understand Irene in culturally and more than others. They cannot be the right reasons for her not studying, but she had and enjoyed the life of a very happy college freshman. However, she is putting a lot of effort into graduating from the university that she entered after overcoming all kinds of difficulties.
